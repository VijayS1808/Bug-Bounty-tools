# Bug-Bounty-tools

## Intro:
I have created tools for peoples which are using google cloud shell for bug hunting beacuse it's has very boring to install tools again again in google cloud shell.

## Tools include:

1) Dalfox
2) waybackurls
3) httpx
4) arjun
5) photon
6) nuclei
7) gau
8) httprobe
9) gf
10) Gf-Patterns

Note: If gf not installed properly, Please install manually.
